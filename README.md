# java-scripts
Simple utility scripts written in Java.

These scripts are written as single-class files, easy to use, with zero dependencies to other libraries and no packaging involved.
Java 8 is the minimum required. 

To use one of these scripts, clone the repo, and run (e.g.:):
* javac HumbleDownload
* java HumbleDownload <...parameters...>

Most of the scripts have a help text that is displayed when you run the respective script with no parameters.  

Enjoy!
